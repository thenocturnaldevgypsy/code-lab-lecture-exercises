## ![SECTION About this Repository](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/-About%20this%20Repository-2471AE?logo=repo&logoColor=white&labelColor=2471AE)

`DuskGrimoires` is an old library that contains Java source codes I've coded and used during my career as Assistant Professor for BSCS, BSIT and BSCOE way back late 2012 to 2015.

> [!NOTE]
> *I've created this repo as a reminder to myself that Java was one of the programming languages I got **heavily** exposed when I was teaching in College/University. It's also a good way to refresh my Java, GitHub and Markdown skills. And just a reminder, the codes here were initially made way back 2012 and been updated regularly until 2015. So I only did some **best effort** to make sure that the codes that are in this repo can be compiled and can be read thru by users.*
